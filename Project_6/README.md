  ## ðŸ”§ Data Processing Pipeline

  ### 1. Data Exploration

  - **Row Count Analysis**: Total dataset size assessment
  - **Sample Data Review**: Initial data structure examination
  - **Null Value Detection**: Data quality assessment
  - **Category Analysis**: Product category distribution
  - **Stock Status Review**: In-stock vs out-of-stock analysis
  - **Duplicate Detection**: Multiple SKUs for same products

  ### 2. Data Cleaning

  - **Zero Price Removal**: Eliminated products with zero MRP
  - **Currency Conversion**: Converted prices from paise to rupees (Ã·100)
  - **Data Validation**: Ensured data consistency and accuracy

  ### 3. Business Analysis Queries

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Analysis Queries

### Q1: Top 10 Best Value Products
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountedSellingPrice
FROM zepto
ORDER BY discountedSellingPrice DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
**Purpose**: Identify premium products with highest absolute savings

### Q2: High-Value Out-of-Stock Products
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp
FROM zepto
WHERE outofstock = TRUE AND mrp > 300
ORDER BY mrp DESC;
```
**Purpose**: Highlight revenue loss from expensive unavailable items

### Q3: Revenue Estimation by Category
```sql
SELECT category, 
       SUM(discountedSellingPrice * availableQuantity) AS total_revenue
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue;
```
**Purpose**: Category-wise revenue potential analysis

### Q4: Premium Low-Discount Products
```sql
SELECT name, mrp, discountPercent
FROM zepto
WHERE mrp > 500 AND discountPercent < 10
ORDER BY mrp DESC, discountPercent DESC;
```
**Purpose**: Identify high-margin premium products

### Q5: Categories with Highest Average Discounts
```sql
SELECT category, 
       ROUND(AVG(discountPercent), 2) AS avg_discount
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_discount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
**Purpose**: Discount strategy analysis by category

### Q6: Price Per Gram Analysis
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, discountedSellingPrice,
       ROUND(discountedSellingPrice / weightInGms, 2) AS price_per_gram
FROM zepto
WHERE weightInGms >= 100
ORDER BY price_per_gram DESC;
```
**Purpose**: Value-based pricing comparison for bulk items

### Q7: Product Weight Segmentation
```sql
SELECT name, weightInGms,
       CASE 
           WHEN weightInGms < 1000 THEN 'Low'
           WHEN weightInGms < 5000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Bulk'
       END AS category_by_weight
FROM zepto;
```
**Purpose**: Product classification for logistics planning

### Q8: Total Inventory Weight by Category
```sql
SELECT category,
       SUM(weightInGms * availableQuantity) AS total_weight
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_weight DESC;
```
**Purpose**: Warehouse optimization and logistics planning

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights

- **Pricing**: 13-18% discount range across products
- **Inventory**: Systematic stock tracking and weight-based categorization  
- **Revenue**: Category-wise performance analysis for optimization
- **Value Analysis**: Price-per-gram metrics for bulk products

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Features

- **Data Quality**: Null detection, duplicate analysis, price validation
- **SQL Techniques**: Aggregations, CASE statements, window functions
- **Business Logic**: Revenue calculations, segmentation, ranking

## ðŸš€ Usage
