# Music Database Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze a digital music store database using SQL, containing comprehensive information about artists, albums, tracks, customers, and invoices. The project demonstrates various SQL techniques from basic queries to advanced analytics.

## üìä Database Schema

The database consists of the following interconnected tables:

### Core Tables:
- **artist** - Artist information
- **album** - Album details
- **track** - Individual music tracks
- **genre** - Music genres
- **media_type** - Media format types
- **playlist** - User-created playlists
- **playlist_track** - Junction table linking tracks to playlists
- **customer** - Customer information
- **employee** - Employee records
- **invoice** - Purchase invoices
- **invoice_line** - Detailed invoice line items

## üîó Setting up Relationships (Foreign Keys)

The first step in this project is establishing proper relationships between tables using foreign key constraints:

```sql
-- Link albums to artists
ALTER TABLE album
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_album
FOREIGN KEY(artist_id)
REFERENCES artist(artist_id);

-- Link tracks to albums
ALTER TABLE track
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_track_album
FOREIGN KEY(album_id)
REFERENCES album(album_id);

-- Link tracks to media types
ALTER TABLE track
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_track_medi_type
FOREIGN KEY(media_type_id)
REFERENCES media_type(media_type_id);

-- Link tracks to genres
ALTER TABLE track
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_track_genre
FOREIGN KEY(genre_id)
REFERENCES genre(genre_id);

-- Link playlist tracks to tracks
ALTER TABLE playlist_track
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_playlist_track_track
FOREIGN KEY(track_id)
REFERENCES track(track_id);

-- Link playlist tracks to playlists
ALTER TABLE playlist_track
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_playlist_track_playlist
FOREIGN KEY(playlist_id)
REFERENCES playlist(playlist_id);

-- Link invoice lines to tracks
ALTER TABLE invoice_line
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_invoiceline_track
FOREIGN KEY(track_id)
REFERENCES track(track_id);

-- Link invoice lines to invoices
ALTER TABLE invoice_line
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_invoiceline_invoice
FOREIGN KEY(invoice_id)
REFERENCES invoice(invoice_id);

-- Link invoices to customers
ALTER TABLE invoice
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_invoice_customer
FOREIGN KEY(customer_id)
REFERENCES customer(customer_id);
```

### Initial Data Exploration

After setting up the relationships, we explore all tables to understand the data structure:

```sql
SELECT * FROM album;
SELECT * FROM artist;
SELECT * FROM track;
SELECT * FROM invoice;
SELECT * FROM customer;
SELECT * FROM genre;
SELECT * FROM invoice_line;
SELECT * FROM employee;
SELECT * FROM media_type;
SELECT * FROM playlist;
SELECT * FROM playlist_track;
```
